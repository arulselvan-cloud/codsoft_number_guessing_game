# 🎯 Number Guessing Game in C++

A fun and interactive console-based game built using **C++** where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a given range.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of:

- Random number generation
- Loops and conditional statements
- User input handling
- Game logic implementation in C++

The program continuously guides the player by indicating whether the guessed number is **too high** or **too low** until the correct number is found.

## 🚀 Features

✨ Random number generation between 1 and 100  
✨ Interactive user input  
✨ Instant feedback on guesses  
✨ Unlimited attempts until correct answer  
✨ Beginner-friendly C++ project  
✨ Clean and simple console interface

## 💻 How the Program Works

### Step 1
The program generates a random number between **1 and 100**.

### Step 2
The user is asked to guess the number.

### Step 3
The program checks the guess:
- If the number is greater → `"Too high"`
- If the number is smaller → `"Too low"`
- If correct → `"Congratulations!"`

### Step 4
The loop continues until the correct number is guessed.
